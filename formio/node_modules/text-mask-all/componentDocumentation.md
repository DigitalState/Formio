## `mask`

`mask` is an array or a function that defines how the user input is going to be masked.

### `mask` array

The way to define a mask in Text Mask is through an array.

Each element in the array has to be either a string or a regular expression. Each string is a fixed character in the mask
and each regular expression is a placeholder that accepts user input. 

The regular expression will be used to test user input and either allow it or reject it.

For example, a mask for a U.S. phone number such as `(555) 392-4932`, could be:

```js
['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]
```

That means the user can enter only a number between 1 and 9 in the first placeholder, and only a digit in the placeholders
after that. 

Any valid regular expressions should work.

Note: it is possible to set the mask to `false` to disable masking completely.

### `mask` function

You can also pass a function as the `mask`. The function will receive the user input at every
change. The function is expected to return a `mask` array as described above.

```js
var mask = function(rawValue) {
  // add logic to generate your mask array
  return [ /*your mask array*/ ]
}
```

This feature is useful when we want to format a user input of unknown length, such as
formatting a number to currency or formatting a string to email address mask.

For an example of a mask function, see the source code of
[`createNumberMask`](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/addons/src/createNumberMask.js),
which is a [Text Mask addon](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/tree/master/addons/#readme).

Note: it is possible to return `false` from a mask function to disable masking completely.

## `guide`

`guide` is a boolean that tells the component whether to be in *guide* or *no guide* mode.

**It is set to `true` by default.**

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Guide mode</th>
<th>No-guide mode</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/guideMode.gif"/>
</p>

<p>
When <code>guide</code> is <code>true</code>, Text Mask always shows both placeholder characters and non-placeholder
mask characters.
</p>
</td>

<td>
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/noGuideMode.gif"/>
</p>

</p>
When <code>guide</code> is <code>false</code>, Text Mask doesn't print out placeholder characters and only adds mask
characters when the user reaches them as they're typing.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## `placeholderChar`

The placeholder character represents the fillable spot in the mask. The default placeholder
character is underscore, `_`.

For example, with mask...

```js
['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]
```
 
...the user would fill out `(___) ___-____`.

You can pass a different placeholder character. For example, the unicode character `U+2000` would
make the mask above look like `(   )    -    `. In JavaScript, you would pass such unicode character
as `'\u2000'`.

&#x1F4CD; **Note**: you cannot use a mask that has a placeholder character hard-coded in it. That
is, since the default placeholder character is `_`, you cannot have a mask that looks like
`_111_` unless you pass `placeholderChar` that is not `_` and doesn't exist
in your mask.

## `keepCharPositions`

`keepCharPositions` changes the general behavior of the Text Mask component.

**It is set to `false` by default**,

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><code>keepCharPositions</code> is set to <code>true</code></th>
<th><code>keepCharPositions</code> is set to <code>false</code></th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/keepCharPositionsTrue.gif"/>
</p>

<p>
When <code>true</code>, adding or deleting characters will not affect the positions of existing characters.
</p>
</td>

<td>
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/keepCharPositionsFalse.gif"/>
</p>

</p>
When <code>false</code>, adding characters causes existing characters to advance. And deleting characters
causes existing characters to move back.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## `pipe`

You can provide a `pipe` function that will give you the opportunity to modify the conformed value before it is
displayed on the screen.

The `pipe` function receives:

1. `conformedValue`
1. `config`

The `conformedValue` is the value that the user entered after it has been conformed. `config` is an object that 
contains all the user configurations for Text Mask (the ones detailed on this page).

The `pipe` function must return one of the following: `false`, `string`, or `object`.

Return `false` to reject the new conformed value and keep the input field from changing.

If the `pipe` modifies the string without adding new characters, for example, changing letter capitalization or removing
characters, it should return the modified string. 

If the `pipe` adds new characters to the string, it must return an object with the following keys:

1. `value`: the new string
1. `indexesOfPipedChars`: array of integers, which contains the indexes of all the characters that were added by the
`pipe` to the conformed value

For an example of a pipe, see the code for
[`createAutoCorrectedDatePipe`](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/addons/src/createAutoCorrectedDatePipe.js)
which is a [Text Mask addon](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/tree/master/addons/#readme).


## `showMask`

`showMask` is a boolean that tells the Text Mask component to display the mask as a
placeholder in place of the regular placeholder when the input element value is empty.

## Included `conformToMask`

[`conformToMask`](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/core/src/conformToMask.js)
 is the function that Text Mask uses to transform text to the given mask.

#### Importing it

It is included with Text Mask components for convenience. So you can import it from the Text Mask
package as follows

```js
import textMask, {conformToMask} from 'where-you-import-text-mask-from' 
```

#### Using it

`conformToMask` accepts three arguments:

* text (string) (required)
* [mask](#mask) (array) (required)
* config (object) (optional)

`config` is [these values](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/core/src/conformToMask.js#L9-L14).
The linked variable names have similar names to properties that are described above in this document. So you can 
learn what each one is for by reading the documentation above.

The return value of `conformToMask` is an object with the following shape:

```json
{
  "conformedValue": "(123) 123-1234",
  "meta": {
    "someCharsRejected": false
  }
}
```

So, one way to use `conformToMask` could be as follows:

```js
var phoneNumber = '5551234444'
var phoneNumberMask = ['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]

var conformedPhoneNumber = conformToMask(
  phoneNumber,
  phoneNumberMask,
  {guide: false}
)

console.log(conformedPhoneNumber.conformedValue) // prints (555) 123-4444
```

## Known issues

### Supported `<input>` types

Please note that Text Mask supports input type of `text`, `tel`, `url`, `password`, and `search`. Due to a limitation
in browser API, other input types, such as `email` or `number`, cannot be supported. However, it is normal to let the 
user enter an email or a number in an input type `text` combined the appropriate input mask.
